# Hello-world

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor along the lines of Sublime. It supports certain Visual Studio features like Intellisense and git integration, but you don't directly run apps from it (though through continuous integration you can deploy stuff like web apps straight to production). Visual Studio Code is available on Windows, OSX and Linux.
